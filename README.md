# SCP-503

## Description of the SCP
This SCP is called The Luckiest Man in the World; during his tests, he won everytime all the boardgames, and survived a lot of disaster, like the 9/11, airplane crashes; he survived a 34 floor fall, 60 projectiles, a projectile which passed trought the centre of the hearth. I "recreated" this into SCP:SL (and yes, he can be eliminated, if you don't set 894981269417987129 as health in the configs ;) )


## Configurable Functions
You can set a lot of things like:
- SCP Health
- SCP Role
- How much damage he will take from others scp
- How much damage he will take from a tesla shock


## Others
If he use an elevator, that will take a half of the time to arrive and transport the player (others players too, if SCP 503 called)
If he use a RADIO, the drain of the battery will be divided by 2
If he fall, the damage he should take will be divided by 3
